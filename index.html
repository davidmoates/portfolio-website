								<h2>My First <a href="https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/life-logger-fe">Labs Project Website, Life Logger</a></h2>
								<p class="justify">Life Logger was my labs project. I worked with 3 other developer and a Team Lead to build on top of a life task manager app. Usually we would have a mix of Back-end, Front-end, UX, and iOS/Android Developer, yet we only had member that went through the Full-Stack Development Curriculum. We started with 8 developer counting our Team Lead but after a week or so into the project we lost 3 of our member due to different circumstances. Most Labs teams have anywhere between 8-15 people. We turned this into a postive by communicating well and developing a friendship with everyone in our group. We worked extremely well and efficiently though none of us were in the same state. We communicated through Zoom and Slack. Together we recreated the whole app on the front-end side. I created a new logo and remade the Create Task form as well as the Edit Task form.</p>

							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon brands fa-git">
									<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a></h3>
									<p class="justify">Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon brands fa-html5">
									<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a></h3>
									<p class="justify">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. <a href="elements.html">See some different elements here.</a></p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon brands fa-css3-alt">
									<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a></h3>
									<p class="justify">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon brands fa-js">
									<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a></h3>
									<p class="justify">JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon brands fa-react">
									<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)">React</a></h3>
									<p class="justify">React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded. However, fetching data is only the beginning of what happens on a web page, which is why complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon brands fa-python">
									<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a></h3>
									<p class="justify">Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
